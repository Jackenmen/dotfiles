#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Sauce Code Pro Nerd Font Complete Mono
bold_font        Sauce Code Pro Bold Nerd Font Complete Mono
italic_font      Sauce Code Pro Italic Nerd Font Complete Mono
bold_italic_font Sauce Code Pro Bold Italic Nerd Font Complete Mono

font_size 11.0

#: Font size (in pts)

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

cursor #ff0018

#: Default cursor color

cursor_text_color #fffaf4

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background

cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline). Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal.

#: }}}


#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_pager_history_size 50

#: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
#: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
#: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
#: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
#: implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively 10000
#: lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII text,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

#: }}}


#: Mouse {{{

url_color #ffffff
url_style single

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, single, double, curly

show_hyperlink_targets yes

#: When the mouse hovers over a terminal hyperlink, show the actual
#: URL that will be activated when the hyperlink is clicked.

click_interval 0.15

#: Mouse actions {{{

#: If you want to unmap an action map it to ``no-op``. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed no-op

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

mouse_map left            click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection prompt
mouse_map right        release ungrabbed paste_from_selection

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  no
initial_window_width  100c
initial_window_height 30c

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead. A single value sets all
#: four sides. Two values set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three
#: values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right,
#: bottom and left.

window_padding_width 4

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

resize_in_steps yes

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with an
#: initial_window_width and initial_window_height in number of cells,
#: this option can be used to keep the margins as small as possible
#: when resizing the OS window. Note that this does not currently work
#: on Wayland.

confirm_os_window_close 1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab that has at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it. A value of zero disables
#: confirmation. This confirmation also applies to requests to quit
#: the entire application (all OS windows, via the quit action).

#: Advanced {{{

allow_remote_control socket-only

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty. Reloading the config will not affect this
#: setting.

listen_on unix:@mykitty

#: Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
#: control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
#: instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
#: line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
#: unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
#: variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
#: replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
#: kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
#: is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
#: remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
#: details. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

shell_integration no-rc

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells.  Set to
#: ``disabled`` to turn off shell integration, completely. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ for details.
